    <p>3.1 Your own text, images, audiovisual media and any other form of intellectual property, including the data, ideas, inventions, designs, patterns and processes in such material (collectively, "Content") that you post on or through the feedbakLOOP Service belongs to you and you may use it in any other way without restriction. But by using the feedbakLOOP Service, you are granting feedbakLOOP and certain third parties permission to use your Content as described in these Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>3.2 By using the feedbakLOOP Service, you are granting feedbakLOOP a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable right and license to use, reproduce, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display your Content on and through the feedbakLOOP Service and on and through services affiliated with feedbakLOOP, regardless of the form of media used or of whether such services now exist or are developed in the future. If you post Content on or through the feedbakLOOP Service, you represent and warrant that you have the right to post that Content and to grant the above rights to feedbakLOOP.</p>
    <p>3.3 feedbakLOOP may preserve your Content and may also disclose such Content, with or without notice to you, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce these Terms of Service; (c) respond to claims that your Content violates the rights of any third party; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of feedbakLOOP, its users and the public.</p>
    <p>3.4 You understand that posting your Content on or through the feedbakLOOP Service is entirely voluntary and will expose your Content to public display in a non-confidential manner. You understand that feedbakLOOP and/or any past, present or future client of feedbakLOOP (each, a "Client") may view your Content and may develop or have developed Content which is identical or similar to yours, may already know of such Content from other sources or may have taken or will take some other action with respect to such Content. Therefore, you represent and agree to all of the following and acknowledge that feedbakLOOP and its Clients are explicitly relying on such representations and agreement with regard to your Content:</p>
       <p>3.4.1 The Content represents your own original work and you have all necessary rights to disclose the Content. In doing so, you are not violating the rights of any third party and you know of no other individual or entity whose rights will be infringed by the Content being viewed and used as described in these Terms of Service.</p>
       <p>3.4.2 Your disclosure of the Content does not violate a confidential relationship with any third party, establish a confidential relationship with feedbakLOOP or any of its Clients or obligate feedbakLOOP or any of its Clients to treat your Content (or any related materials) as secret or confidential.</p>
       <p>3.4.3 feedbakLOOP and/or any of its Clients may give your Content such consideration as is warranted by their respective judgments. Review of your Content shall not be construed as any recognition of the novelty or originality of the Content. Neither feedbakLOOP nor any of its Clients is obligated to give reasons for making use of or rejecting your Content or to reveal its activities that are related to your Content.</p>
       <p>3.4.4 Neither feedbakLOOP nor any of its Clients has any obligation, either express or implied, to make any use of your Content. However, if feedbakLOOP and/or any of its Clients do make use of your Content, whether such use is intentional or inadvertent, no compensation will be due to you or anyone else for the use of your Content or the use of any data, ideas, inventions, designs, patterns and/or processes similar to, related to or derived from your Content.</p>
       <p>3.4.5 Neither feedbakLOOP nor any of its Clients assumes any obligation with respect to any of your Content except as set forth in these Terms of Service, unless and until it enters into a separate written contract with you, and then only as expressed in that separate written contract. In the absence of a separate written contract, your rights with regard to feedbakLOOP or any of its Clients' user of your Content shall be as described in these Terms of Service and as existing under the patent laws of the United States.</p>
       <p>3.4.6 If your Content is the subject of a pending or issued patent, you have disclosed or will disclose that fact in connection with posting your Content on or through the feedbakLOOP Service. To the extent you hold a patent in the Content, no license under any patent is herein granted. Any license to use patented Content shall be in the form of a separate written contract, in which event your, feedbakLOOP's and/or any of its Clients' respective obligations shall be only those expressed in such separate written contract.</p>
       <p>3.4.7 Neither the discussion or negotiations between you, on the one hand, and feedbakLOOP and/or any of its Clients, on the other hand, relating to the possible purchase or license of your Content, nor the making of any offer for the purchase or license of your Content, shall prejudice feedbakLOOP and/or any of its Clients in any way, or be construed as recognition of the novelty, originality, priority, other rights or value of your Content. Further, feedbakLOOPâs and/or any of its Clients' consideration, discussions or negotiations with you will not in any way impair feedbakLOOP's and/or any of its Clients' right to contest the validity or infringement of your rights in and to the Content.</p>
       <p>3.4.8 You hereby irrevocably release and forever discharge feedbakLOOP and its Clients and their affiliates and subsidiaries (together, the "Released Parties") from any and all actions, causes of actions, claims, damages, liabilities and demands, whether absolute or contingent and of any nature whatsoever, which you now have or hereafter can, shall or may have against the Released Parties or their respecting successors and assigns with respect to the Content, including without limitation in respect of how the Released Parties, directly or indirectly, use the Content, with the sole exception that the foregoing release and discharge does not apply to your right to bring a claim of patent infringement arising from use of your Content.</p>
    <p>3.5 Content posted by another person or company on or through the feedbakLOOP Service belongs to the poster. Except as expressly permitted in these Terms of Service, you do not have the right to use, reproduce, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform or publicly display any Content that does not belong to you, other than viewing of the Content on or through the feedbakLOOP Service as feedbakLOOP may make available.</p>
